# Blockchain Development Experience
# I am uday kiran pedda
Welcome to my blog! I share insights, research, and hands-on experiences in blockchain security,
smart contract auditing, and DeFi protocol analysis. With a strong focus on security reviews, gas optimization, CTF challenges, 
and vulnerability assessments, I explore real-world attack vectors and defense mechanisms.

#What You’ll Find Here:
- **Smart Contract Auditing – Analyzing vulnerabilities and security flaws in Solidity contracts.
- ** Security Research – Deep dives into contract exploits, reentrancy attacks, and gas efficiency.
- ** CTF Challenges – Solving blockchain security puzzles to sharpen my auditing skills.
- ** DeFi Security – Reviewing the latest trends and risks in decentralized finance.
- ** Testing & Analysis – Using Foundry, Slither, Hardhat, and Remix for contract verification.


## Skills & Expertise
